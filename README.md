## Creating Venv 
**Venv:** A seprate sandbox to run our program.

### Venv Using uv
Using [uv](https://pypi.org/project/uv/) as it's an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver, written in Rust.
Designed as a drop-in replacement for common `pip` and `pip-tools` workflows.

#### To install uv:
```
pip install uv
```
#### To create venv

```
uv venv  # Create a virtual environment at .venv.

```
#### To activate venv
```
# On Windows.
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
#### To deactivate 
```
deactivate
```
#### To install packages into venv
```
uv pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install from a requirements.txt file.
```

```

## Starting Django Project
To start a project in django:
```
django-admin startproject OnDjango
```
- Here, `django-admin` is the main command.
`startproject` is used once, to initate a project.
`OnDjango` is our project name.
- Later will use `startapp` for multiple `apps` in django.

- we have OnDjango a sub-folder inside main OnDjango folder, which is commond in Django projects.

#### Run manage.py
run your `manage.py` using static command `runserver`.
```
OnDjango\manage.py runserver
